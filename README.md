==beanfactory==
Most basic example of using spring beanfactory
* beandefinitions in xml resource file
** only one namespace required in this file:
*** one for beans 

* echo bean has reference to messageProvider interface
* two implementations of that interface can be injected.

Beanfactory is very basic for more features use the application context factory instead.
